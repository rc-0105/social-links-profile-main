## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project i learned how to make an <a> cover all the space to make it act like a button, also put it a hover so the user can see witch button is pressing, i imported an image to personalize the social links profile.

Also i tried to use the list of semantical html call ul.

```html
<ul class="social-links">
      <li class="social-link">
        <a href="https://github.com/rc-0105">GitHub</a>
      </li>
      <li class="social-link">
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardo-c-0105/">LinkedIn</a>
      </li>
      <li class="social-link">
        <a href="https://twitter.com/rc_0105">Twitter</a>
      </li>
      <li class="social-link">
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rc_0105/">Instagram</a>
      </li>
</ul>
```

In this case i use the next css to make the <a> work like a button
```css
li a{
    text-decoration: none;
    font-weight: 700;
    font-size: 14px;
    width: 100%;
    display: block;
    color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}
```

### Continued development

I think that i did it great, i will use this code again in other projects to be more productive, if you some comments or helpfull advices ill be gratefull to hear.
